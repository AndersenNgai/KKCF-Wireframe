Using Github Codespaces do the following:
- Build your previously created home page wireframe (or create a new wireframe) using Bootstrap 
- Providing images is optional: feel free to use placeholders
- Include the navbar - links don't have to work  but you should use the <a> tag
- Get close! Does not have to be exact, we want to see the general shape of your wireframe
- Experiment and have fun!
- Submit both of the following:
  - The link to your github repo - must be public
  - A screenshot of your wireframe you are using for reference
